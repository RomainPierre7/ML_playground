# Linear Regression

## Introduction
This project is a simple implementation of linear regression using the least squares method. The project is written in Python and uses the numpy library for matrix operations.

## Usage
The project is written in Python 3. To run the project, you need to have the numpy library installed. You can install it using pip3:
```bash
pip3 install numpy
```

To run the project, simply run the main.py file (feel free to modify it to your needs) using the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Architecture
The project is divided into the following files:
- ```main.py```: The main file that runs the project.
- ```model.py```: Contains the implementation of linear regression models using the least squares method and their corresponding evaluation methods. Contains also the solver using the least squares method.
- ```metrics.py```: Contains the implementation of several metrics to evaluate the performance of the linear regression models.
- ```fit_optimizer.py```: Contains a few fitting algorithms to optimize the model.
- ```plot.py```: Contains the implementation of the plot method to visualize the datasets and their corresponding linear regression models.
- ```dataset.py```: Contains examples of datasets according to their linear regression models and splitting dataset functions.
